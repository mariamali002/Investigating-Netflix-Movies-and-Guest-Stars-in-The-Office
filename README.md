# Analyzing Average Movie Durations on Netflix

Netflix has become the largest entertainment/media company in terms of market capitalization, with millions of subscribers worldwide. With its extensive collection of movies and series, it presents an excellent opportunity to explore the entertainment industry through data analysis.

 # Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze the average duration of movies on Netflix over a specific time period. We have been provided with information on the average movie durations for the years 2011 to 2020, as follows: 103, 101, 99, 100, 100, 95, 95, 96, 93, and 90.

# Tools and Techniques
To perform the analysis, we will be utilizing the following tools and techniques:

Python: We will use the Python programming language for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
Pandas: The pandas library will be used to create and work with DataFrames, which provide a powerful data structure for efficient data manipulation and analysis.
Jupyter Notebook: We will work within a Jupyter Notebook environment to execute and document our code step by step.
